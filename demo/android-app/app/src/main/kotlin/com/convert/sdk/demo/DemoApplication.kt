/**
 * Story 7.1 AC-3 (F-166) — Application subclass that initialises the
 * [ConvertSDK] singleton on a background dispatcher at process start.
 *
 * ### Background-dispatcher init (architecture NFR)
 *
 * Architecture §4 NFR-12 (`no main-thread blocking`) and §11
 * (`Never use Dispatchers.Main inside the SDK`) are contractually
 * stronger than this story's earlier "synchronous init in onCreate"
 * draft: ConvertSDK.builder(...)…build() pulls in disk I/O (cache),
 * code-generation (the OpenAPI client), and reflection — all of which
 * can stretch into the hundreds of milliseconds on cold start. The
 * 2026-05-05 demo-app logs ("Choreographer: Skipped 174 frames!" and
 * a 4002 ms Davey on cold start) confirmed the symptom in production.
 *
 * The fix moves the build chain into a [Deferred] launched on
 * [Dispatchers.Default] — `onCreate()` returns immediately after
 * starting the deferred; consumers (event subscribers, runners) await
 * it as needed. The SDK is therefore visible to consumers as a
 * suspending value, not a synchronously-available field.
 *
 * The same off-main-thread discipline extends to the per-visitor
 * [ConvertContext]: `sdk.createContext()` reads/writes the visitor-id
 * file, so it is also pre-warmed inside [contextDeferred] on
 * [Dispatchers.Default] (Story 7.3 propagation of F-166). Synchronous
 * runner calls (`runExperience` etc.) read from the deferred when it
 * is already complete and return `null`/empty otherwise — matching
 * the [ExperienceRunner] docstring.
 *
 * The SDK key is compiled into [BuildConfig.convertSdkKey] — see
 * `app/build.gradle.kts` for how `local.properties`'s `convertSdkKey`
 * entry flows into the build. When no entry is present the default
 * `"demo-sdk-key"` is used; the SDK initialises, the first config
 * fetch fails quietly, and the rest of the demo still launches
 * cleanly (plenty for scaffolding / AC-10).

     * The demo cannot read `sdk.dataManager` directly (the property is

     * panel requires by asking the per-visitor [ConvertContext] for
     * its eligible experience and feature sets — `runExperiences()` /

     * current visitor". A visitor outside an experience's audience
     * will see that experience omitted from the list — which is the
     * correct signal for a developer debugging audience rules.

     * [com.convert.sdk.android.ConvertSDK.isTrackingEnabled] accessor.

     * deferred has not landed yet) renders as `"—"` in
